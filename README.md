# CaesarCypher
Caesar Cypher program

The program acts as a encoder tool, by shifting the string fed to the program with the rules given to it, to creat a encoded string.
In this instance the string "What a String!" is being translated into ASCII and then shifted by 5, and being translated back into normal characters, the encoder will ignore special characters and take into consideration upper and lower case characters.
